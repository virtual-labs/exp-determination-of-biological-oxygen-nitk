### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">The Biochemical Oxygen Demand (B.O.D.) of sewage or of polluted water is the amount of oxygen required for the biological decomposition of dissolved organic matter to occur under aerobic condition and at the standardised time and temperature. Usually, the time is taken as 5 days and the temperature 20&deg;C as per the global standard. The B.O.D. test is among the most important method in sanitary analysis to determine the polluting power, or strength of sewage, industrial wastes or polluted water. It serves as a measure of the amount of clean diluting water required for the successful disposal of sewage by dilution. The test has its widest application in measuring waste loading to treatment plants and in evaluating the efficiency of such treatment systems.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">The test consists in taking the given sample in suitable concentrations in dilute water in B.O.D. bottles. Two bottles are taken for each concentration and three concentrations are used for each sample. One set of bottles is incubated in a B.O.D. incubator for 5 days at 20&deg;C; the dissolved oxygen (initial) content (D<sub>1</sub>) in the other set of bottles will be determined immediately. At the end of 5 days, the dissolved oxygen content (D<sub>2</sub>) in the incubated set of bottles is determined. Then,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;">Where,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;"><p style="text-indent:50px;">P = Decimal fraction of sample used.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;">D<sub>1</sub> = Dissolved oxygen of diluted sample (mg/l), immediately after preparation.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;">D<sub>2</sub> = Dissolved oxygen of diluted sample (mg/l), at the end of 5 days incubation.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">Among the three values of B.O.D. obtained for a sample select that dilution showing the residual dissolved oxygen of at least 1mg/l and a depletion of at least 2mg/l. If two or more dilutions are showing the same condition then select the B.O.D. value obtained by that dilution in which the maximum dissolved oxygen depletion is obtained. Waste water from sewage treatment plants often contains organic materials that are decomposed by microorganisms, which use oxygen in the process. (The amount of oxygen consumed by these organisms in breaking down the waste is known as the Biochemical Oxygen Demand or BOD).</p>

Objectives that we accomplish from BOD determination :
<li>To assess the quality of surface water and waste water</li>
<li>To establish the amount of organic matter in samples</li>
<li>To understand the significance of Dissolved Oxygen in sample</li></br>
