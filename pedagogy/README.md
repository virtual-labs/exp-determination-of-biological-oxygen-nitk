#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Formative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the
students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory
apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| See the displayed objectives, apparatus and solutions used then click on next button | Display objective, apparatus and solutions used | Recall the experiment
2.| Click on the bottle-containing water sample to open its lid, take the sample in cylinder, and transfer 200ml each of the sample into two BOD bottle, then dilute the sample by adding distilled water to it, then label both the BOD bottles as Sample A and Sample B | Display take 200ml of sample in 2 BOD bottle and dilute it with dilution water by filling the bottle up to the neck | To provide basic environment to start the experiment
3.| Click on the automatic pipette, take 1ml of MnSO<sub>4</sub> solution from the beaker, and add it to BOD bottle containing Sample A | Display add 1ml of MnSO<sub>4</sub> solution to Sample-A bottle | To add MnSO<sub>4</sub> solution
